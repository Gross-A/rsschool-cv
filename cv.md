# Personal Statement:

I am 39 years old.\
Currently I work in one of the branches of a large energy company as the head of the "information and communication systems" service.\
There is an opportunity to develop further in this direction, but I want something else.\
To my favorite things, it would bring pleasure from the process itself, programming is suitable: I like to "brainstorm" over non-trivial tasks, to implement them; to investigate, to look for reasons, "poking around" in details; not be tied to a "work chair" from 8.00 to 17.00 from Monday to Friday ...\
This is the main reason why I am here.\
Today I am only at the beginning of the journey, but this makes it even more interesting!
